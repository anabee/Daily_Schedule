# Daily_Schedule
A daily schedule by hour 


PSEUDO CODE - 
1. simple html with a header, a div section to hold the current date, a div for the actual schedule portion 
2. Inside the actual schedule portion, I will add inputs and corresponding buttons that will be for the user to input their information and buttons so that the user can save their information to localStorage 

Functionality 
1. Build a timer using Moments.js that will display the current date 
2. allow for input that is added into the different fields to be added to the localStorage 
3. The buttons should be adding the information inputed to the input field (the even listener will trigger the save)
4. There has to be sime type of function built that will change the font color of past times in the day, it will look at the current time and tell the user if the time has past

Where to start:
1. Start by building the basic layout with only one input and button, once that is set up run it through an iteration that will make the same thing and append it to itself ??
